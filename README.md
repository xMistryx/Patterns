# Patterns

In this problem set, you'll learn some common coding patterns that you'll use for the rest of your programming career!

## Instructions

Test files are already written for you in the `__tests__` folder. Complete the functions in the `patterns` folder according to each section below. The first problem of each section comes with a sample solution that you can use as reference.

## Guard

A **guard** is a conditional usually placed at the beginning of a function that prevents the rest of the function from being run if certain conditions are not met. A function can have more than one guard.

Complete the functions in `guard.js` to pass the tests in `guard.test.js`.

## Accumulator Variable

An **accumulator variable** is used to keep track of information as a program executes, usually alongside a loop. Sometimes, the accumulator variable might update depending on a condition.

Complete the functions in `accumulator.js` to pass the tests in `accumulator.test.js`.

## Return Timing

Almost all of the functions we've seen so far return something at the very end. If we already have an answer, we don't always need to iterate through the entire array. For these problems, think about _what_ to return and _when_ to return!

Complete the functions in `timing.js` to pass the tests in `timing.test.js`.

## Nested Loops and Arrays

You can loop inside a loop, and you can have arrays of arrays!

Complete the functions in `nested.js` to pass the tests in `nested.test.js`.
